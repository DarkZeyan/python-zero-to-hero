    "# Tuples in Python\n",

    "## What is a Tuple?\n",
    "- Tuples are a Data Structure very similar to lists. However they have one key difference - immutability. They're immutable.  This means they cannot be mutated or changed. \n",
    "    - Once an element is inside a tuple (assigned to an index position), it cannot be reassigned.\n",
    "    - Tuples use **parenthesis**: ***(1,2,3)*** instead of square brackets  which are the ones lists use.\n"
